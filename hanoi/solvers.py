"""
Tower of Hanoi solvers - recursive and iterative algorithms.

This module implements various algorithms for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
The primary implementation uses the classic recursive approach, which is both
optimal (uses minimum number of moves) and educational (demonstrates recursion).

The recursive algorithm follows the divide-and-conquer strategy:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination

This approach guarantees the optimal solution of 2^n - 1 moves for n disks.

    Standard recursive Tower of Hanoi solver.
    
    This is the classic recursive algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
    It uses a generator to yield moves one at a time, making it memory-efficient
    for large numbers of disks. The algorithm is optimal, requiring exactly
    2^n - 1 moves to solve a puzzle with n disks.
    
    The recursive strategy works by:
    1. Recursively moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
    2. Moving the largest disk from source to destination
    3. Recursively moving n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination

        n: Number of disks to move (must be positive)

        c: Auxiliary peg (default: 1, peg B)

    Recursive solver with trace events for visualization.
    
    This enhanced version of the recursive solver generates trace events that
    can be used to visualize the recursive algorithm's execution. Each recursive
    call generates "enter" and "exit" events, while each move generates a "move"
    event. This allows the visualization to show the recursion tree structure
    and highlight the current execution path.
    
    The trace events are used by the visualization module to create an
    interactive recursion tree that shows how the algorithm progresses.
