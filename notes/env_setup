# Setup Notes: Step 1 (Environment Setup)

In the terminal, I ran:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # (on macOS/Linux; on Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pytest


What each command does

python3 -m venv .venv
    Creates a virtual environment in a folder called .venv.
    This is like a self-contained workspace where Python libraries live, so they don’t mess with your global system Python.

source .venv/bin/activate
    Activates the virtual environment. Once activated:

Your terminal prompt usually changes to show (.venv) at the beginning.

Any pip install only affects this project, not your whole system.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    Updates pip (Python’s package manager) to the latest version inside this virtual environment.

pip install pytest
    Installs pytest, a testing framework we’ll use to check that our Tower of Hanoi code works correctly.
    This also goes only into .venv, not your global Python.

Why this matters
    Keeps project dependencies isolated.
    Lets anyone else working on the repo replicate the same environment by creating and activating .venv and installing dependencies from a requirements file later.
